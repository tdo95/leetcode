# 🏆 Leetcode Coding Challenges

### Welcome to the Chamber of Blood Sweat and Tears 
This repository is where I store all the solutions I've created to solve coding challenges across the internet. 

#### What is a Coding Challenge? 🧩
A coding challenge is a computer based test that assess your ability to use math and logic to solve a problem. There are many webstites the host these challenges online for you to complete at leisure. I'm using [Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com), and working through Blind75 on [NeetCode.io](https://www.neetcode.io).

#### Why do them? 🤔 
I love improving as an engineer. I work really hard to not only understand these problems, but also solve them in the most effienct way possible. This sort of deliberate practice is what sharpens your computational logic skills. At the end of the day, my competency as an engineer isn't going to improve on it's own, so I work at it by doing these challenges. Plus... who doesn't love a good puzzle? 😌 😄

<h2 id="notes">📓 Repo Organization & Notes</h2>
I've grouped my solutions based on catagory. Each solution is in a file labeled by the problem name, so if you want to do the same one, you'll be able to find it by seacrching the file name on the platform.  
<br><br>
JavaScript is usually my language of choice, so you'll find most of my solutions are written in that language.<br><br>

Not every solution I've completed is in this repository,  just ones I feel are worth saving. Checkout my profile on each platform for all the other ones Ive done!

#### Thanks for stopping by! 😊
